# 2. Primitives

## Scalar Types
- Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 and isize (pointer size)
- Unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 and usize (pointer size)
- Floating point: f32, f64
- char Unicode scalar values like 'a', 'α' and '∞' (4 bytes each)
- bool either true or false
- The unit type (), whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ()

Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

## Compound Types
- Arrays like [1, 2, 3]
- Tuples like (1, true)

Variables can always be type annotated. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a suffix or by default.
Integers default to i32 and floats to f64. Rust can also infer types from context.

## Literals and Operators

```rust
fn main() {
// Variables can be type annotated.
let logical: bool = true;

    let a_float: f64 = 1.0;  // Regular annotation
    let an_integer   = 5i32; // Suffix annotation

    // Or a default will be used.
    let default_float   = 3.0; // `f64`
    let default_integer = 7;   // `i32`

    // A type can also be inferred from context.
    let mut inferred_type = 12; // Type i64 is inferred from another line.
    inferred_type = 4294967296i64;

    // A mutable variable's value can be changed.
    let mut mutable = 12; // Mutable `i32`
    mutable = 21;

    // Error! The type of a variable can't be changed.
    mutable = true;

    // Variables can be overwritten with shadowing.
    let mutable = true;

    /* Compound types - Array and Tuple */

    // Array signature consists of Type T and length as [T; length].
    let my_array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Tuple is a collection of values of different types
    // and is constructed using parentheses ().
    let my_tuple = (5u32, 1u8, true, -5.04f32);
}
```

Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability, e.g. 1_000 is the same as 1000, and 0.000_001 is the same as 0.000001.
The operators available and their precedence in Rust are similar to other C-like languages.

```rust
fn main() {
// Integer addition
println!("1 + 2 = {}", 1u32 + 2);

    // Integer subtraction
    println!("1 - 2 = {}", 1i32 - 2); // if you change the 1i32 to 1u32 the compiler will raise an error. error: this arithmetic operation will overflow 

    // Scientific notation
    println!("1e4 is {}, -2.5e-3 is {}", 1e4, -2.5e-3);

    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    println!("true AND false is {}", true && false);
    println!("true OR false is {}", true || false);
    println!("NOT true is {}", !true);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);

    // Use underscores to improve readability!
    println!("One million is written as {}", 1_000_000u32);
}
```

## Tuples

A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed using parentheses (), and each tuple itself is a value with type signature (T1, T2, ...), where T1, T2 are the types of its members. 
Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.
Tuples with more than 12 elements, cannot be printed.

## Arrays and Slices

An array is a collection of objects of the same type T, stored in contiguous memory. Arrays are created using brackets [], and their length, which is known at compile time, is part of their type signature [T; length].
Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time. 
Instead, a slice is a two-word object; the first word is a pointer to the data, the second word is the length of the slice. 
The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture, e.g. 64 bits on an x86-64. 
Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array and have the type signature &[T].

```rust
use std::mem;

// This function borrows a slice.
fn analyze_slice(slice: &[i32]) {
    println!("First element of the slice: {}", slice[0]);
    println!("The slice has {} elements", slice.len());
}

fn main() {
    // Fixed-size array (type signature is superfluous).
    let xs: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // All elements can be initialized to the same value.
    let ys: [i32; 500] = [0; 500];

    // Indexing starts at 0.
    println!("First element of the array: {}", xs[0]);
    println!("Second element of the array: {}", xs[1]);

    // `len` returns the count of elements in the array.
    println!("Number of elements in array: {}", xs.len());

    // Arrays are stack allocated.
    println!("Array occupies {} bytes", mem::size_of_val(&xs));

    // Arrays can be automatically borrowed as slices.
    println!("Borrow the whole array as a slice.");
    analyze_slice(&xs);

    // Slices can point to a section of an array.
    // They are of the form [starting_index..ending_index].
    // `starting_index` is the first position in the slice.
    // `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice.
    println!("Borrow a section of the array as a slice.");
    analyze_slice(&ys[1 .. 4]);

    // Example of empty slice `&[]`:
    let empty_array: [u32; 0] = [];
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[]);
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[][..]); // Same but more verbose

    // Arrays can be safely accessed using `.get`, which returns an
    // `Option`. This can be matched as shown below, or used with
    // `.expect()` if you would like the program to exit with a nice
    // message instead of happily continue.
    for i in 0..xs.len() + 1 { // Oops, one element too far!
        match xs.get(i) {
            Some(xval) => println!("{}: {}", i, xval),
            None => println!("Slow down! {} is too far!", i),
        }
    }

    // Out of bound indexing on array with constant value causes compile time error.
    //println!("{}", xs[5]);
    // Out of bound indexing on slice causes runtime error.
    //println!("{}", xs[..][5]);
}
```
