# Hello, world!

## Compile a binary
`$ rustc hello.rs`

## Block comments

It's possible to add '/' before the block comment to uncomment the whole block.
For example:

    /* <- add another '/' before the 1st one to uncomment the whole block
    
    println!("Now");
    println!("everything");
    println!("executes!");
    // line comments inside are not affected by either state
    
    // */
